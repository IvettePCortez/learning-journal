My learning journal for Code 201 for July 2017

LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today I learned the frustrations that come with Git.  I am growing an aversion to Git!
I do like that we have a project to continue working on as we continue on  this journey.  Leaning code is a lot easier when there is an end goal.  

LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Today I learned the process of pair programming.  It was an enjoyable experience, as I am a big believer of working as part of a team and enjoy interacting with others.  I also appreciated the random assignment of a peer programmer because it gave me the opportunity to work with someone whom I may not have reached out to on my own.  
Working with my peer programmer was a big help for me, especially because she has very concise and clean code - something I am aiming to do.  I learned that even though I came across a broken browser, a pair of new eyes really helps!
