My learning journal for Code 201 for July 2017

LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today I learned the frustrations that come with Git.  I am growing an aversion to Git!
I do like that we have a project to continue working on as we continue on  this journey.  Leaning code is a lot easier when there is an end goal.  

LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Today I learned the process of pair programming.  It was an enjoyable experience, as I am a big believer of working as part of a team and enjoy interacting with others.  I also appreciated the random assignment of a peer programmer because it gave me the opportunity to work with someone whom I may not have reached out to on my own.  
Working with my peer programmer was a big help for me, especially because she has very concise and clean code - something I am aiming to do.  I learned that even though I came across a broken browser, a pair of new eyes really helps!  

LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today I learned that what Brandy said the first day of class was ABSOLUTELY correct.  I fell deep into that pit of despair later in the afternoon when I was unable to log my functions onto the browser.  The more shuffling about I did with my code, the more it seemed to break, and the less I felt capable of what I am learning.  There were many helpers along the way, yet nothing really seemed to sink in fully - how frustrating!
Later in the evening, I realized that I had been really hungry for a while.  In realizing this, I packed up my belongings, walked to my car, drove to PCC to pig out on some pumpkin ravioli and cherry tomatoes, went home, and - EUREKA! - my Id tags were off, thus rendering my code useless.  After making those fixes, code works (sort of).  Moral of the story... ravioli save the day!

LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Today I learned to listen to myself.  I had my site working relatively well, my table had the data and, while it was a bit off cells, it was present and visible.  My brain was fried and I knew I needed to take a break, submit what I had and go on my way - it was the right thing to do.  I did not do the right thing.  I stayed, tried to make it "perfect"... and now, I have a missing table.  
It is infuriating, because I knew I had to rest.  I knew that I could no longer code.  I didn't listen. Now I have to debug. Again.  

Note to self: Listen to yourself!

LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Today I learned that even though the logic may be there, bugs find a way.  I have been feeling as an impostor for most of this week, but today I thought about all that I have learned in the past 2 weeks - it's a lot! I can't possibly be so hard on myself.  Having a growth mindset is key.  I know that I can learn, and I have to trust that I will continue to develop into a strong web dev. It won't happen over night, but with practice and grit, it will happen!

Note to self:  Have a beer, don't be so hard on yourself!

LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Today I learned that I am being deterred by one of my personality traits.  I'm some sort of mix between stubborn and a perfectionist.  What I realized this means at this point is that I am missing out on credit because I am too proud (that's the word!) to turn in an assignment that is not entirely finished, or presentable.  This is a learning experience, not an exercise in finding perfection. 
I am learning that coding is not the only thing I am learning through this course.  This is a life and character changing experience.  

Note to self: Be open to growth and change.
